# Turtle-Crossing-Game
100 DoC Python Day 23 Project: Crossing Turtle Game

### This Python program does the following:
1. Uses the Python Turtle Module to create all of the visuals
2. Creates a turtle shaped Turtle object and allows it to move forward on Up key press, using the onkey() method
3. Creates several randomly-colored rectangle-shaped Turtle object at random coordinates and gets them to move at a random pace
4. Creates different levels of the game where each level has more number of rectangle-shaped objects, moving at a faster pace
5. Provides logic for winning and losing the game where:
    * If the turtle-shaped object collides with any rectangle-shaped object, the game is over and there is no further code execution
    * If the turtle-shaped object safely reaches the finish line, then resets its position and proceeds to the next level
6. Uses the write() method from Turtle to provide user feedback when the game is over, and also display Level # on top-left side of the screen
7. Uses OOP style to make the code more readable and dynamic
